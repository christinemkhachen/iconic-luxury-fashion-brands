# Iconic luxury fashion brands

## Description

 While creating this project, I really wanted to integrate two true passions of mine. Fashion and coding. my main goal was to build an app which showcased how fashion has transcended over the years and some of it's most iconic looks. There are a few labels to check out and I can't wait on adding more data and images in the near futute, I hope you enjoy!
