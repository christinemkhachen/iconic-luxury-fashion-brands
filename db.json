The interpretation of “L.V” as “Live” and “Love” reminds consumers to live their lives to the fullest and pursue their passion in life. By combining the phrase 'the Truth' with “L.V”, “Live the Truth” or “Love the Truth” can refer to consumers being true and confident in expressing their personal fashion style, brand or lifestyle choices.",
